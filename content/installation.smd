[]($section.id("posix"))
##  Linux,  MacOS,  FreeBSD and  Termux

Fetch and install the latest release with the installation helper script:

```
curl -fsSL https://flow-control.dev/install | sh
```

Install the latest nightly build:

```
curl -fsSL https://flow-control.dev/install | sh -s -- --nightly
```

with debug symbols:

```
curl -fsSL https://flow-control.dev/install | sh -s -- --nightly --debug
```

See all available options for the installer script:

```
curl -fsSL https://flow-control.dev/install | sh -s -- --help
```

Install the installer for easy updating of flow:

```
sudo curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/update-flow https://flow-control.dev/install
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/update-flow
update-flow
```

At the top of the installer are variables to pre-answer the installation
questions. Configure them to your liking.

We have some tips for [Android](/docs/platform/android/)

[]($section.id("windows"))
##  Windows

For Windows the installer scripts are a little different.

Fetch and install the latest release to `%AppData%/Roaming/flow/bin`:

```
Invoke-RestMethod "https://flow-control.dev/install.ps1" | Invoke-Expression
```

Install the latest nightly build:

```
Invoke-RestMethod "https://flow-control.dev/install-nightly.ps1" | Invoke-Expression
```

Install the latest nightly build with pdb debug symbol files:

```
Invoke-RestMethod "https://flow-control.dev/install-debug.ps1" | Invoke-Expression
```

The Windows installer will also install itself as `update-flow.ps1` so you can
just run `update-flow` in a terminal to update to the latest release or nightly.


[]($section.id("source"))
##  Build from Source

See the [Building section of `README.md`](https://git.flow-control.dev/neurocyte/flow/src/branch/master/README.md#building)
in the source repository for build instructions.


[]($section.id("tarball"))
##  Manual install from tarballs or zip files

See the [downloads](/downloads) page for binaries that you can manually install.
Just download, unpack, and place the binary anywhere you want. There are no
runtime files required and configuration directories and files are created on
demand.
