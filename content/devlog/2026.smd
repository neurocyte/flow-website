## About this Devlog

I try to keep a log of major (and some minor) changes and new features
going into flow as I work on them.

You can [subscribe to this page via
RSS]($link.page('devlog').alternative('rss')) and find more devlog entries
in the [archive](/devlog/).

# [Release 0.7.0 🎉]($section.id("2026-02-13T09:21:56+01:00"))

We kick off the new Year with a major release!

## Completion

Flow now has full **inline auto completion** support! There is a new
dropdown UI with support for insert and replace completion styles while
editing inline. An info popup box can display completion and hover
documentation and there are commands to toggle modes and styles
interactively.

There are three completion trigger modes available:
- `manual` - completion is triggered via keybind to the `completion` command
- `automatic` - completion is triggered whenever a trigger character is inserted
- `every_keystroke` - completion is triggered on every insert operation

Trigger characters are provided by the current document's LSP. Note that a
completion request may not always return results and in that case no
completion UI will be shown. Completion items that insert LSP snippets are
now supported and the next snippet tab stop can be selected with the `tab`
key. There are two keybind modes for inline completion. `standard` mode
will steal the `up/down` and `enter` keys from the main editor and
`noninvasive` mode that will not. `noninvasive` mode requires that you use
the alternate keybindings `ctrl+n`/`ctrl+p` to pick a completion item
and `tab` to select it. These keybindings also work in `standard` mode.

The original palette style completion UI is also still available and may be
selected with the `toggle_completion_style` command.

#### Keybinds:
- `ctrl+space` or `ctrl+.` - manually trigger completion
- `ctrl+space` (when completing) - toggle info box, info panel or no info
- `up`, `down`, `ctrl+p`, `ctrl+n`  - pick a completion item from the list
- `enter`, `tab`  - select and insert a completion
- `esc` - cancel completion
- `ctrl+k r` - toggle insert or replace completion mode
- `alt+f9` - select next completion dropdown UI widget style
- `shift+alt+f9` - select next info box widget style

Configuration options:
- `completion_trigger`
- `completion_style`
- `completion_insert_mode`
- `completion_info_mode`
- `dropdown_keybinds` - `standard` or `noninvasive`
- `dropdown_limit`


## Vertical Splits

Flow Control can now show multple editors in vertical, side by side, views.
Each split can have it's own tab bar and tabs may be moved between splits
with mouse or keyboard commands. Commands or palettes that navigate to
files now have an "alternate" mode that will open the file in a new split
if it is not already open.

#### Keybinds:
- `ctrl+\` - add_split
- `ctrl+k w` - close_split
- `ctrl+1` to `ctrl+8` - focus_split
- `ctrl+page_down` - select tab right
- `ctrl+page_up` - select tab left
- `ctrl+shift+page_down` - move tab right
- `ctrl+shift+page_up` - move tab left
- `shift+enter` - (palette or command) navigate to file in a new split


## Centered View

When only one split is open on a wide screen you can now center the view.
The width of the centered view is controllable with keybinds and/or the
`centered_view_width` configuration option.

#### Keybinds:
- `ctrl+k x` - toggle centered view
- `alt+-` - shrink centered view
- `alt+=` - expand centered view


## Horizontal scrolling

Horizontal scrolling with a horizontal mouse wheel is now supported. Also,
scrolling the regular vertical mouse wheel with the `shift` key pressed
will now scroll horizontally. Fast scroll (hold the 'alt' key) is also
supported for horizontal scrolling.


## Git Diffs

Diff markers in the editor gutter are now based on the git HEAD commit if
the current project is a git repository. Also, the new commands
`goto_next_change` and `goto_prev_change` will move the primary cursor to
the next/previous marker in the gutter.

#### Keybinds:
- `alt+f5` - goto_next_change
- `alt+shift+f5` - goto_prev_change


## Blame

Git blame information for the current line is displayed in the remaining on
the line. This can be toggled with the `toggle_inline_vcs_blame` command.

#### Keybinds:
- `ctrl+shift+g alt+b` - toggle_inline_vcs_blame


## Variable Expansions

Tasks and `filter` bindings may now use variable expansions in their
arguments. Variable names to be expanded should be wrapped in `{{` and
`}}`.

The following variables are available in this release:

- `{{project}}` - The path to the current project directory
- `{{file}}` - The path to the current file
- `{{line}}` - The line number of the primary cursor
- `{{column}}` - The column of the primary cursor
- `{{selection}}` - The current selection of the primary cursor
- `{{selections}}` - All current selections seperated by NL characters
- `{{selectionsZ}}` - All current selections separated by NULL characters
- `{{indent_mode}}` - The current indent mode (`tabs` or `spaces`)
- `{{indent_size}}` - The current indent size (in columns)
- `{{blame_commit}}` - The blame commit ID for the line at the primary cursor (if there is one)


## Highlight References

Added support for the LSP `textDocument/documentHighlight` request as the
`highlight_references` command. Flow will automatically mark the results of
this query as matches so you can use the the `goto_next_match` and
`goto_prev_match` commands to navigate them. `highlight_references` is also
available as an idle action for automatic reference highlighting (See the
Idle Actions secion below)

#### Keybinds:
- `ctrl+k i`


## Auto Run Commands, Auto Backups & Session Saving

`auto_run_commands` and `auto_run_time_seconds` can be used to configure
commands that will run automatically like a cron job. `save_session` and
`save_session_quiet` commands were also added to make auto run useful as a
backup tool.

The default configuration for `auto_run_commands` is `save_session_quiet`
and the default for `auto_run_time_seconds` is 120, so in the (rare!) event
of a flow crash you can return to flow with minimal data loss with `flow
--restart-session`.

The `save_session_and_quit` command was also added for when you want to
manuall exit and restart flow with `flow --restart-session`.


## Idle Actions & Commands

Idle actions & commands run whenever the user pauses their interaction with
flow. Actions are specific functions designed to run on idle. At the moment
just `hover` and `highlight_references`. These actions have commands to
toggle them interactively. The idle timeout is configured with the
`input_idle_time_ms` option.


## Find Mode

There are now three find modes. Exact match, case folded (insensitive)
and auto mode. Auto mode (the new default) selects to do an exact match
search or case folded search depending on whether the query term contains
case foldable characters or not. So if you enter a lowercase search term
you get a case insensitive search. Also, auto find mode (which searches as
soon as you select something) now has a command (and a keybind) to toggle
it on/off.

#### Keybinds:
- `alt+c` (in find mode) - toggle exact or case folded search mode
- `alt+f3` - toggle auto find mode


## Key Hints

There is a new key hints overlay that displays all currently available
keybindings. It can be explicitly activated with `alt+f1` or `ctrl+?`, and
will be automatically displayed when an incomplete keybinding sequence is
waiting for additional input. The key hints overlay is invisible to mouse
events and can be active in any flow input mode or submode.

#### Keybinds:
- `alt+f1` or `ctrl+?` - show/hide the key hints overlay
- `shift+f1` or `ctrl+alt+?` - next key hints page
- `shift+alt+f9` - next widget style for key hints


## Restart with Sudo

You can now restart the flow session with `sudo` to save files with root
permissions. The current session, with unsaved file content (but currently
not undo info), is first saved and then automatically restored when flow is
restarted by sudo. If the `sudo` command fails for any reason the saved
flow session can be reloaded as usual with `flow --restart-session`. Flow
now displays a red lock symbol in the status bar and a (configurable)
warning message on the home screen when running with root permissions.


## Symlinks

Flow can now follow symlinks when writing files and scanning the project
tree. New options `retain_symlinks`, `follow_directory_symlinks` and
`maximum_symlink_depth` control symlink behavior. Symlink following on file
save (`retain_symlinks`) is now enabled by default.
`follow_directory_symlinks` when scanning the project tree is not enabled
by default.


## Symbols Palette

Added support for the LSP `textDocument/documentSymbol` request with a
palette interface to browse and filter symbols in the current document.

#### Keybinds:
- `ctrl+shift+o` - open the symbols palette
- `enter` - jump to the highlighted symbol
- `shift+enter` - select the highlighted symbol
- `up/down/pgup/pgdn/home/end` - browse the symbols list
- `anything else` - filter the symbols list with a fuzzy search
- `esc` - cancel and return to original document location


## Project switching

Switching projects without exiting Flow Control (`ctrl+r`) now restores
open tabs and splits making for a much smoother multi-project workflow.


## Last Palette

You can now re-open the last used palette with the `last_palette` command.
This restores the state of the palette when last used, which is very
useful, for example, for browsing through multiple files that match a fuzzy
query.

#### Keybinds:
- `ctrl+,` - open lasted used palette
- [helix] `space '` - open lasted used palette


## Goto Matching Bracket

Added the classic goto matching bracket command.

#### Keybinds:
- flow - `ctrl+shift+\`
- emacs - `C-M-p C-M-n`
- vim - `%`
- helix - `mm`


## Reflow text

The `reflow` command can soft wrap paragraphs of text. There is basic
detection of the line prefix to aid in reflowing indented or commented
blocks of text. Blank lines are preserved as paragraph boundaries. The
default line width for `reflow` is configured with the `reflow_width`
config option and can also be specified for the current, and any following,
`reflow` operation with an integer command parameter. (`alt+1`, etc.)

#### Keybinds:
- `alt+q` - reflow paragraph


## LSP Configuration

The `open_lsp_config_global` and `open_lsp_config_project` will open a json
file where you can add LSP configuration that is sent to the LSP on startup
via the LSP `initializationOptions` init request field. Project and global
configurations are not merged in anyway and project config overrides global
config entirely. The project (and global) LSP configuration is stored in
the flow configuration directory, even for project specific config.
