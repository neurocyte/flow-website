## a programmer's text editor

Flow Control is under active development, but usually very stable.

[]($video.siteAsset('video/flow-control.mp4').controls(true))

## 🚀 Features
- **Lightning Fast** TUI with ≤6ms response times
- **Tree-sitter** powered syntax highlighting
- **Language Server Protocol** pre configured support for most language servers
- Multi-cursor editing & mouse support
- Cross-platform (Linux/macOS/Windows/Android)
- VSCode/Vim keybindings + custom schemes
- Hybrid rope/piece-table buffer system

## Requirements
- A modern terminal with 24bit color and, ideally, kitty keyboard protocol support. Kitty,
    Foot and Ghostty are the only recommended terminals at this time. Most other terminals
    will work, but with reduced functionality.
- NerdFont support. Either via terminal font fallback or a patched font.
- Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android (Termux) or FreeBSD.
- A UTF-8 locale

## 📦 Installation

Fetch and install the latest release to `/usr/local/bin` with the installation helper script:

```
curl -fsSL https://flow-control.dev/install | sh
```

Install latest nightly build and (optionally) specify the installation destination:

```
curl -fsSL https://flow-control.dev/install | sh -s -- --nightly --prefix ~/.local/bin
```

See all avalable options for the installer script:

```
curl -fsSL https://flow-control.dev/install | sh -s -- --help
```

### Prebuilt Binaries
- Stable: [Releases](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/releases/latest)
- Nightly: [Nightly Builds](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow-nightly/releases/latest)

Or check your favorite local system package repository.

### Build from Source
```bash
# Basic build
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe

# Cross-compile examples
zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-windows --prefix zig-out/win64
zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-linux-musl --prefix zig-out/arm-linux
```

The binary is:

```
zig-out/bin/flow
```

It is statically built (by default) and contains all the required tree-sitter parsers
and queries. No additional runtime files are required. Place it in your path for convenient
access.

## Configuration

Configuration is mostly dynamically maintained with various commands in the UI.
It is stored under the standard user configuration path. Usually `~/.config/flow`
on Linux. %APPDATA%\Roaming\flow on Windows.

Logs, traces and per-project most recently used file lists are stored in the
standard user application state directory. Usually `~/.local/state/flow` on
Linux and %APPDATA%\Roaming\flow on Windows.

Kitty, Ghostty and most other terminals have default keybindings that conflict
with common editor commands. We highly recommend rebinding them to keys that are
not generally used inside TUI applications.

For Kitty rebinding `kitty_mod` is usually enough:
```
kitty_mod ctrl+alt
```

## 🛠️ Basic Usage
```bash
flow file.zig:42                    # Open at line 42
flow --language zig CMakeLists.txt  # Force file type
flow --list-languages               # Show all supported languages
flow --help                         # List of command line options
```

## ⌨️ Key Controls
| Command            | Action               |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| `F4`               | Switch input mode    |
| `Ctrl+Shift+P`     | Command palette      |
| `Ctrl+F2`          | View all keybindings |

Run the `Edit keybindings` command to save the current keybinding mode to a
file and open it for editing. Save your customized keybinds under a new name
in the same directory to create an entirely new keybinding mode. Keybinding
changes will take effect on restart.


## 🛣️ Roadmap
