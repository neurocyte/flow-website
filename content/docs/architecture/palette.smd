Palettes are overlay menus that allow to select an item from the
presented list, applying a command with the selected element,
optionally deleting the selected item; it's possible to close
the palette without selecting(cancel), filter the elements, and
having special elements that trigger different actions.

To get the most of this section, it's recommended to have
read about [commands](/docs/architecture/command), and optionally
[minimodes](/docs/architecture/minimode).
