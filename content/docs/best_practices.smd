In all proects we have agreements and the communication process and
integrating anything is faster when we use the learnings to make
everything repeatable.  Things can be improved and what is considered
best today, tomorrow can change, we offer some advises in this section.

## Use enums instead of booleans on message parameters

enums are expressive and allow to understand the intent, take a look
at [this refactor](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/pull/343/commits/5827f58414c1f31151433ce88dcc2ead28a4b876)
which enhances a line selection, to include end of line or exclude it,
afterwards, it was implemented an option to maintain cursor position
when selecting a line.

## Use if possible keybinds over programming

It's possible that certain action can be achieved composing
various previous commands, if unsure if something is already
implemented given that the source code is not clear at some
point, [please ask](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx).

If you find something that worths be here, please
[edit this page](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow-website/tree/master/content/docs/architecture/command.smd).
