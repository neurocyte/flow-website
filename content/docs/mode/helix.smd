This document describes Helix Mode implementation.

## [What and what not]($section.id('what'))

The first and biggest difference is that Flow has a mode that emulates
Helix, or at least has equivalent of the worthiest actions that can be
done with Helix. The conversely is not true.

When entering to Helix Mode through `F4`, you land on `NOR`
[imode](/docs/architecture/keybind#hierarchy), there are `SEL` and
`INS` imodes implemented.

`:` opens up Flow's rich command palette that might have
functionalities Helix users are used to have, if you find something
missing, it's possible to
[open a feature request](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/issues),
make sure to review
[other issues](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Ahelix-mode)
to avoid repeating or see in [Discord](https://discord.gg/kzJC9fA7)
to ask if there is a workaround, or anyone else is interested in
porting your requirement; adding a reaction to an issue offers
awareness on what to implement or to get higher priority, remember that
it is possible to bounce back to Flow(f4) mode if needed.

## [Enhancing hx mode]($section.id('enhancing'))

This is a programmer's editor, you are more than welcome to enhance to
suit your needs that maybe coincide with others.

Take a look at [architecture](/docs/architecture) and
[contributing](/docs/contributing) for an overview and the mechanics
of getting your changes into flow.

hx mode is modal kind, the same as vim mode, and the file that has the
particular work to make it real is `src/tui/mode/helix.zig`, adding
a `command` and the corresponding `meta` is what is required.
[More on commands](/docs/architecture/command).

### [Pickers]($section.id('pickers'))

Flow hx mode offers most of the Helix pickers functionalities with
`panels` and [palettes](/docs/architecture/palette).  Example of panels
are the `g` `r` (go to reference from lsp) and `space` `/` (a.k.a find
in files). Examples of `palettes` are `space` `b` to pick a buffer or
`space` `f` to open a file in your project. Panels open below the
editor while palettes open overlapping the working area.

## [Next steps]($section.id('next'))

Said all of this, it's possible to start contributing via pull
requesting [keybinds](/docs/architecture/keybind),
[commands](/docs/architecture/command),
[palettes](/docs/architecture/palette), or anything you wish were here.
