## Asking for a feature

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/issues) that
explains what is the requirement, being as descriptive as
possible.  First review other issues in case someone already
requested the feature, or join
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx) to ask for
more information.  At the end, the issues in github have more
chance to get developed, given that there are plenty of things
to do for this kind of software.

## Reporting a problem

If you discover a problem, or unexpected behaviour, feel free to
join [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx) to check
if there is a simple way to overcome the inconvenience or to get
some guidance.  [Reporting a bug](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/issues)
is a good way to contribute. When reporting one, it should contain:

* Flow version. You get it with `flow --version`
* What you were doing, if possible, step by step to reproduce it
* What actually happened
* What was expecting to happen
* Any other information, like screenshots, video, screencast, the
platform allows to add that information.

Issues later on are tagged with proposed version to solve them, in case
it's a low hanging fruit, it's possible that it can be solved pretty
quick.

Spreading the word is another way to contribute to Flow Code growth.

## Developing

[Flow Control](https://flow-control.dev/) is programmed with
[zig](https://ziglang.org/).

[Fork](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/fork), no worries, if you
happen to use [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/neurocyte/flow), or
[sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~neurocyte/flow), it's possible to
fork and contribute via those services too.

Using [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx) is a good
starting point to discuss about what you are about to offer, or if
you decide to pick an open issue, is a good practice first
commenting in one of the channels to get some feedback and get to
agreements or find guidance.

This [summary](/docs/architecture) can help on getting started to
follow the codebase.

### Coding style

Please follow what you see in the source code for functions, Structs,
variables, const names, etc...  Functions have descriptive names to
use less time adding and maintaining comments to communicate the
purpose and intent. Don't worry about commenting each function, module
or parameter, there are automated tools that are currently helping
with this, take a peek on [deepwiki](https://deepwiki.com/neurocyte/flow);
if you find something inaccurate in this doc or others, do open an
issue or jump in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx)
and comment, it's valid to
[improve too](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow-website/tree/master/content/docs/contributing.smd").

### Commit comments

It's better to use commits for different purposes, even if they look small and
there is a temptation to include on the same new code, fixes and refactors. Making
concise and self contained commits make review easier and future fixes possible,
in case of need.

Use these prefixes as much as you can, doing so helps when identifying the features
and eases the process of letting others know about what's new, fixed and help
communicate better when releasing.

* `feat:` when there is a new feature, if specific to a mode, please use
`feat: [mode]`.
* `refactor`: when reorganizing code, usually when you make something clearer
for future readers and commiters.
* `fix:` When something changed to a more expected behaviour.
* `build`: the commit doesn't change code at all.

### Testing

It's possible that the test set grows as the project evolves, given
that the amount of relationships among components increase the
opportunity to generate regressions. If you are new to zig a good
place to start to learn about the codebase is
[adding some tests](/docs/testing)

## Getting in touch.

[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx) and
[Github issues](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/issues) are the
main channels to do so.
