## Asking for a feature

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/issues) that
explains what is the requirement, being as descriptive as
possible.  First review other issues in case someone already
requested the feature, or join
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx) to ask for
more information.  At the end, the issues in github have more
chance to get developed, given that there are plenty of things
to do for this kind of software.

## Reporting a problem

If you discover a problem, or unexpected behaviour, feel free to
join [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx) to check
if there is a simple way to overcome the inconvenience or to get
some guidance.  [Reporting a bug](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/issues)
is a good way to contribute. When reporting one, it should contain:

* Flow version. You get it with `flow --version`
* What you were doing, if possible step, by step to reproduce it
* What actually happened
* What was expecting to happen
* Any other information, like screenshots, video, screencast, the
platform allows to add that information.

Issues later on are tagged with proposed version to solve them, in case
it's a low hanging fruit, it's possible that it can be solved pretty
quick.

Spreading the word is another way to contribute to Flow Code growth.

## Developing

[Flow Control](https://flow-control.dev/) is programmed with
[zig](https://ziglang.org/).

[Fork](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/fork), no worries, if you
happen to use [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/neurocyte/flow), or
[sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~neurocyte/flow), it's possible to
fork and contribute via those services too.

Discussing via [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx) is a good
start to talk about what you are about to offer, or if you decide to pick
an open issue, is a good practice first opening an issue and
commenting in one of the channels to get some feedback and get to
agreements or find guidance.

This [summary](/docs/architecture) can help on getting started to
follow the codebase.

### Coding style

Please follow what you see in the source code for functions, Structs,
variables, const names, etc...  Functions have descriptive names to
use less time adding and maintaining comments to communicate the
purpose and intent. Don't worry about commenting each function, module
or parameter, there are automated tools that are currently helping
with this, take a peek on [deepwiki](https://deepwiki.com/neurocyte/flow),
if you find something inaccurate in those docs or others, do open an
issue or jump in [Discourse to comment](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx)
and comment.

### Testing

It's possible that the test set grows as the project evolves, given
that the amount of relationships among components increase the
opportunity to generate regressions.

## Getting in touch.

[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx) and
[Github issues](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/issues) are the
main channels to do so.
