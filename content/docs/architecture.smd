This document describes in a general way, concepts that help to
understand how the code is organized and where to look at when starting
to contribute developing Flow Control.  Make sure you have read
first [help.md](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/blob/master/help.md)
and use the editor at least in flow mode. We recommend reading the
[deepwiki description](https://deepwiki.com/neurocyte/flow) for a more
in depth documentation and joining
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4wvteUPphx) to ask from the
simplest.  If something does not look accurate on this documentation or
in deepwiki. Do not hesitate to ask in the channels and open a PR to
improve anything.

## Internals

The foundational unit is the `Buffer` that holds the document in memory;
there might be various opened files, each one loaded in a buffer.
A buffer can be ephemeral, meaning, it is not related to a file, that
might be the product of a `Task` run.  Buffers are implementations of
ropes that offer multiple services such as insert characters, load from
file, write to file, load from string, return as string, tell if it has
unsaved changes(dirty), among many others. A buffer can have multiple
`Selections` and `Cursors` interacting with it. The `Buffer Manager`
offers services around the set of buffers.

A `Project` initially is the directory where flow is opened at, once
opened, it starts processes to discover the files under the directory
hierarchy, interact with lsp and git. When flow is opened, only one
active project is loaded in the current session. The `Project Manager`
offers services around the set of projects.

## Editor commands and modes

When a buffer is active, it has an `Editor` attached to it; an editor
might have associated tree-sitter support, given the file type detected,
and offers common services that are aimed to be used by `Commands` to
manipulate the contents of a buffer at a higher level, the selections,
cursors, cursor selections `CurSel` and the `View`. The commands are
used by `Modes` with `Keybindings`. The main mode is Flow and the
keybindings can be used to map to a mode built up entirely on solely
calling already created commands. An example of a mode created by
command composition is `Emacs` mode, for instance, it's possible to
create a nano mode with just keybindings. In the other hand, `Vim` and
`Helix` modes have particular definitions for commands that interact
with the buffers, being modal editors.

## Text user interface

`Tui` governs it all offering support for `Palettes` that are known
in other environments as pickers, as well as offering information
through a set of `_views` (i.e. `logview`, `inputview`,
`inspector_view`) and `status` (i.e. `tabs`, `clock`, `branch`,
`linenum`).

## Operating systems and UI

[libvaxis](https://github.com/rockorager/libvaxis) is in charge of
rendering the text and all the interface in Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD,
while in Windows there is an special GUI.

## Communication between components

[Thespian](https://github.com/neurocyte/thespian) is in charge of
processes synchronization and allows sending messages between
different flow components, for example, when a widget needs
updating information from changing states of internal data and
when components or external processes take time and need to return
an answer, all this without blocking the user interface. Tree-sitter
queries to highlight the current file of a particular
language and LSPs usually take time by the nature of operations they
perform, integration with git and running a `shell` command via a
`task` all are coordinated thanks to the infrastructure that
Thespian provides.

## Programming languages support

There are plenty of programming languages that use tree-sitter via
[flow-syntax](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow-syntax) and whose
language servers and formatters are configured via `file_type_lsp`.
Currently one Language Server is supported for each language.

## Facilities

The clipboard is used for copy, paste operations and there is also
support to use the system clipboard, copying and pasting to/from it.

Logging support offers various levels to give feedback for several
actions that ease developing Flow itself and also are used to offer
feedback via `logview`.
